  <h1>My Quest to Code</h1>
  
  <p>Hi there. My name is Gianina, but I like Gia so much better. I am a healthcare worker. I work as an EKG/telemetry tech at Aurora Healthcare here in Milwaukee, WI. It's super fun and rewarding knowing that everyday, just noticing a change in my patient's cardiac rhthym, I save lives. Imade the transition from sales to healthcare at the start of the pandemic in 2020. I felt that as an able-bodied person, I should be doing something to help. So, I did. I've always wanted to be a programmer. I never thought of myself to be smart enough though. But, with the support of great family...I have begun my journey.</p>
  <p> I have decided not to attend a four year college for a CS Degree. I have looked in to dozens of bootcamps. I don't have $15,000 just lying around and didn't want to get sucker into "taking the bootcamp for free and pay when you get hired" thing. It may work for some people, but personally, I'm not a fan of giving up 15%-20% of my salary for 2-10 years. Instead, I have found every free resource known to man(aka Google). There's so many sites that offer some seriously beautiful courses that not only are indepth, but totally beginner user friendly. If you're not trying to obtain a heafty student debt or take out a loan for bootcamp, check out <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, or audit a class or two at <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>.
